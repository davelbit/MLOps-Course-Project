MLOps-Course-Project
==============================
[Checkout the course](https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/)

The goal of this project is to get familiar with the best practices of MLOps. In the center is not the output of a neural network, everything around it as: code structure, code/data/model version control, logging, debugging, containerisation, deployment, monitoring...


The project is build around a classification task. Different X-Rays of patients lungs will be classified in covid-19, pneumonia and normal. 
The dataset is from [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jctsfj2sfn/1) where all classes are represented equally.
The images are black and white with either 1 or 3 Channels.
A convolutional neural network (CNN) will be trained on 80% of the total 4575 samples. Tests will be performed on th eremaining 20%.

In this project the framework [Kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia) will be used primarily for data preprocessing and augmentation. (Maybe we find a usecase for post processing.)
